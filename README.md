## Installation

If you can't install a Vim plugin yet, you are not ready for Vim Castle!

## Usage

* Launch with `:Vimcastle`
* Launch in dedicated mode with `:Vimcastle!` (overrides display settings, quits with `q`)
* Launch from command line: `vim -c 'Vimcastle!'`

## Contributions

Because the basic game mechanisms are not yet in place, I cannot accept code (gameplay or story) contributions. Please create issues with your ideas and suggestions though, I'm not even sure where I'm going with this project so your opinion is welcome!:)
