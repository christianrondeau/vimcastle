Execute (create event):
  let game = vimcastle#game#create()
  let game.player = vimcastle#character#create({'short':'', 'long':''}, 100)
  let game.player.health = 50
  let eventgen = vimcastle#eventgen#create('test')
    \.text('Heal!')
    \.effect('heal', 40)

Execute (effect applies):
  let event = eventgen.invoke(game)

Then (result):
  AssertEqual 90, game.player.health
  AssertEqual ['Heal!', 'You gain <+40> health.'], event.log
