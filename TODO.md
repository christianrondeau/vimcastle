# Vimcastle TODO

## Game

* [ ] Potions (heal)
* [ ] The Void (scene with nothing)
* [ ] Pickup stuff (show equip. diff)
* [ ] con (health), wil (interrupt), spi (magic str)
* [ ] Create character (name, assign stats)
* [ ] Bonus scenes (e.g. +str)
* [ ] Tutorial (predetermined seq. of events) + Test that plays a complete game incl. menu
* [ ] High scores

## Refactors

* [ ] Show base and total stats (e.g. `dmg: 3 [+5]`)

* [ ] Avoid duplicating short names
* [ ] Add tests for extracted utils
* [ ] Review colors
* [ ] README for non-vim users?
* [ ] Test each monster against matching player lvl

## Ideas

* [ ] Special monsters / weapons / scenes with ASCII art (and animations?)
* [ ] Scene can depend on you being (str)ong enough, etc.
* [ ] "Animation" when selecting an action (transitions), e.g. highlight the option, shake, flash, etc.
* [ ] Auto combat (skip)
* [ ] Character class? (May provide special bonuses)
* [ ] Scenes that draw health (e.g. no air, burning floor)
* [ ] Teleport scroll
* [ ] Enchant weapon
* [ ] Steal items (event
* [ ] Temp. effects (e.g. poison hurts, blind hides logs)
* [ ] Temp. buffs (e.g. boost strength)
* [ ] Create your own character
* [ ] Special unique skills (block one hit, steal items  fastrr xp)
* [ ] Map of discovered areas and links
* [ ] Fast travel to previously discovered areas
* [ ] Weapon 'of Light', 'of the King' etc w/ special bonuses like heal, dbl attack, etc
